# TODO

## Sprint 1 – Shared Design Foundations
- [x] Publish shared token source (`shared/design-tokens.js`) and hook up the web theme runtime.
- [x] Wire Expo `ThemeContext`, update Wallet + Settings screens, and align toast/navigation colors with the shared palette.
- [x] Restructure navigation to Wallet / Present / Verify / Settings and land the Present placeholder screen.

## Sprint 2 – Next Up
- [ ] Apply the new theme tokens to the remaining mobile screens (Identity, Scanner, VC details, etc.).
- [x] Flesh out the presentation builder flow (request ingestion, selective disclosure, signed responses).
- [ ] Expand VC management features (filtering, revocation, QR export) using the shared design system.
